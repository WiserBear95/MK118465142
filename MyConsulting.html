              Consulting

                  “I want to work in consulting to prepare myself for launching my own company. Entering college, I came to admire Elon Musk as my idol because he defied the odds to save Tesla Motors by winning the $50 million Daimler investment and launched Space X with most of his personal wealth from EBay to defy the odds and win over NASA contracts. He has a vision to make world-changing impacts and he inspired me to launch my own venture.
              I hope to build up the skills necessary to run and lead an organization by joining consulting. In addition, as a consultant, I would wake up every day to tackle real problems troubling businesses. That really excites me and it’s what prompted me to join every case competition that came across my path during my 4 years in college.”

                  <br> 1. QUALITY & CONSISTENCY <hr>


                  Delivering consistently high quality products and customer service results in happier, long-term customers. 
                  Quality: Automation ensures that every action is performed identically - resulting in high quality, reliable results <hr>

Consistency: If, for example, you have automated your customer service follow-up process, your customers will consistently experience the same level of service from your business
This guarantee of quality and consistency coupled with time and efficiency savings means that you can start developing higher quality and more feature-filled products with little or no increase in production time and costs.<hr>
<br>
REDUCED COSTS<hr>


Manual tasks, given that they are performed one-at-a-time and at a slower rate than an automated task, will cost more. Automation allows you to accomplish more by utilising fewer resources
